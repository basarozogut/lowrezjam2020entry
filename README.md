# Slippery When Frozen - LOWREZJAM 2020 Entry
LOWREZJAM 2020 was a game jam that had an extreme constraint of 64x64 resolution. I had chosen slipperiness from optional themes. I don't consider this as an easy game to play as I was trying to emphasize slipperiness. Also the low and square resolution provided extra difficulty for visibility. Still, it provided a nice challenge of making a game from zero to completion by only myself.

- Game is created using HaxeFlixel game engine using Haxe language.
- Levels are designed in Ogmo Editor.
- Graphics are created with Asesprite which is my favorite pixel-art tool.
- Sfx is generated with sfxr.
- Music is composed using DAWs.
- Only assets that arent created by me are fonts.
